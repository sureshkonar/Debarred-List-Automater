# Debarred-List-Automater for College Assessments ü§ñ
In Simple word this is a Excel sheet Automator Program using Openpyxl Python Library for large Datasets 

Where the program's task is to select the values among the dataset which lies between the specified range and then traversing the selected data into the new sheet of the same excel file

# Problem Statement ‚û°Ô∏è
To implement a python program which automates the process of finding/selecting the data lying in the specified range and traversing them into a new sheet of the same Excel (.xlsx file) 

# Problem Description ‚û°Ô∏è 

This is a Python Code which will 

a) traverse an ExcelFile (format.xlsx)

b) sort the data according to the range such that eg: (80<x<90)

c) now this sorted data is been appended on new sheet of the same (format.xlsx) file according to the mentioned range 

d) the index of entries is also been maintained in a separate sheet called "Index". Where we have total number of entries & students

  # Purpose üìå 

This Program was implemented by us which is used by my College for obtaining debarred students details by setting range to below 75 % ( Attendance Percentage ) from large student records so that the desired work is done by one clicküëÜ  ( just entering the file location & range )
Also to avoid time consumption and human errors while handling such large Datasets

# Our Approach / Timeline ‚åõ

This was a task assigned by our faculties where they wanted us to work on this project round the clock üïí

Things were not easy it took us nearly 5 days to complete the code & achieve the solution for the problem statement

Actually this task made us more flexible toward time limit and managing the same to achieve our final goal ü•Ö

# Format Excel File ( format.xlsx )

[format.xlsx](https://github.com/sureshkonar/Debarred-List-Automator/files/9479612/format.xlsx)

The Excel file that is supposed tp be used in this program  should follow the Columnns Format exactly mentioned in the format xlsx file in the files section

# Note ‚ö†Ô∏è

1) This Program will only work for the specified format file (format.xlsx).
2) File generated By this program in .xlsx format cannot be opened using MS Excel As the generated file violates the File integrity policy of MS Excel.
3) So to overcome this you can use google spreadsheet website i.e (Google Sheets) 
4) Now open generated .xlsx file in google sheets website to view the changes made by the python code

**The Generated file from this program cannot be opened in MS Excel as excel software fails to interpret howw the file is been modifiled hence resulting a File integrity policy violation  
This policy violation corrupts the generated file but on other hand the same file can be opened in google sheets with no issue . So using google sheet will not cause any problem with this program . Hence Google Sheet is recommended to open the generated excel file

# Future Advancements ‚¨ÜÔ∏è

Plan to host the code over cloud editors like  Google Collabs etc such that 
1) No Hardware limitation is achieved üëç
2) The whole code will be available across all the platforms üë®‚Äçüíª
3) The program no longer needs to be installed on local machines üíª
4) Rectifying the MS Excel's Integrity policy while opening the modified file generated by the program
