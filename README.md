# Debarred-List-Automater
This is a Python code which
a) traverse an ExcelFile (format.xlsx)
b) sort the data accordingto the range such that eg: (80<x<90)
c) now this sorted data is been appended on new sheet of the same (format.xlsx) file according to the mentioned range 
d) the index of entries is also been maintained in a separate sheet called "Index". Where we have total number of entries & students

Note : The specified format xlsx file should be used in order to use this automator
       File generated By this program in .xlsx format cannot be opened using MS Excel As the generated file violates the File integrity policy of MS Excel.
       So to overcome this you can use google spreadsheet website i.e (Google Sheets) 
       Now open generated .xlsx file in google sheets website to view the changes made by the python code
